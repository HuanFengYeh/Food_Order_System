## Build/Run
Android Development Setupâ€‹

To set up a new virtual Android device for debugging:

Click Tools > Device Manager (under the Android subheading)
Click New Device
Set up the device you want to emulate - you can just choose the Base Device and leave the default settings if you're unsure
Visual Studio will then download the image for that device. The download progress is shown in the progress in the Android Device Manager dialog.
Once this has completed, the emulated Android device will be available as a build target under Android > Debug > (name of device)

To make sure you have the Android SDK and Emulator installed:

Open Visual Studio

Click Tools > SDK Manager (under the Android subheading)

Click the Tools tab

Make sure the following items are installed:

Android SDK tools (at least one version of the command-line tools)
Android SDK Platform-Tools
Android SDK Build Tools (at least one version)
Android Emulator
Click Apply Changes if you've marked anything for installation

If you've missed anything, Visual Studio should prompt you anyway.
